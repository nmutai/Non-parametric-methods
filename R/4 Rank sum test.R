# Rank sum test

# Example data
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
y <- c(6, 7, 8, 9, 10)

# Conduct rank sum test
wilcox.test(x, y, alternative = "less")

# In this example, the rank sum test is being used to test the null hypothesis that 
# the distribution of the variable in x is not different from the distribution of 
# the variable in y. The alternative argument is set to "less" to test for a specific 
# alternative hypothesis that the distribution of x is less than the distribution of y.

# The output shows the test statistic (W) and the p-value. In this case, the 
# p-value is 1, which means that there is no significant difference between the 
# two distributions and we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
# 
# Note that in this example, the data is artificially created, in real-world 
# scenario we would use the data from the source of interest.
