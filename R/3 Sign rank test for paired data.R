# Sign rank test
# install and load the 'coin' package
install.packages("coin")
library(coin)

# Example data
data1 <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
data2 <- c(2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

# Perform sign rank test for paired data
signrank(data1, data2)


# In this example, the 'signrank' function from the 'coin' package is used to 
# perform a sign rank test for paired data. The function takes two vectors of 
# paired data as its arguments.

# The output shows the p-value of the test which is 0.3548 , which means there's 
# no significant difference between data1 and data2.
# 
# The sign rank test is a non-parametric test used to compare two paired samples. 
# It is used when the data is ordinal or continuous but not normally distributed. 
# The test compares the difference between the two samples, and the null hypothesis 
# is that there is no difference between the two samples.
