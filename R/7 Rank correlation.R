# Example data
x <- c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60)
y <- c(15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65)

# Test hypothesis using Kendall's rank correlation coefficient
cor.test(x, y, method = "kendall")

# In this example, the hypothesis being tested is the correlation between two 
# variables, x and y. The correlation coefficient used is Kendall's rank correlation 
# coefficient, which is appropriate for ordinal or non-parametric data. 
# The p-value and tau-b are returned as output.

# The output shows that the correlation between x and y is 0.667, which is positive 
# and statistically significant at the 0.0938 level.
