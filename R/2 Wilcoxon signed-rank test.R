# Wilcoxon signed-rank test
# install and load the 'wilcox.test' package
install.packages("wilcox.test")
library(wilcox.test)

# Example data
data <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)

# Test the hypothesis that the mean and median are equal
wilcox.test(data, mu=median(data), alternative="two.sided")

# In this example, the 'wilcox.test' function is being used to test the hypothesis 
# that the mean and median of the 'data' vector are equal. The 'mu' argument is set 
# to the median of the data, and the 'alternative' argument is set to "two.sided" 
# to test for equality in both directions (greater than and less than).


# Here p-value of 0.3281 is greater than 0.05 which means we fail to reject null 
# hypothesis and we conclude that there is no evidence to suggest that the median 
# and mean are different.
# 
# In case you want to test for median greater or less than mean, you can change 
# alternative to 'greater' or 'less' respectively.
